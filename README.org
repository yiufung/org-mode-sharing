* Org-mode Sharing

I was lucky enough to talk about Org-mode at my company's sharing
session. This repo contains all information I collected and is most
useful to anyone interested in sharing the great tool to his
colleagues/friends interactively.

It's an extension to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgizHHd7nOo][John Kitchin's video - Org mode is awesome]]. Some
errors due to Org version change are fixed, and more contents added:

- export to docx/GitHub-flavor markdown
- sparse tree example for academic reading
- why plain text matters
- some more pointers to useful resources

You may download John's original file [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/07/12/Org-mode-is-awesome/][here]].

** Prerequisites

 - Emacs 26.2 / Org-mode 9.1.9
 - (Windows) [[https://miktex.org/][MiKTeX]] required for LaTeX/PDF output
 - [[https://www.libreoffice.org/][LibreOffice]] required for Org -> docx conversion

** Notes for presenter

 1. Start vanilla Emacs (init file is *not* required), load basic setup
    by executing code block [[file:intro-org-mode.org::minimal-setup][#minimal-setup]]
 2. (Optional) Clock in [[file:intro-org-mode.org::*Finish%20this%20talk][#Finish this talk]]
    before starting presentation
 3. ~M-x org-present-mode~.

 Thanks to all my colleagues who have been bearing me with my constant
 mentions of "Emacs" and "Org-mode" :)
